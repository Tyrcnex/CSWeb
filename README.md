## Hello!
This place is just for me to backup my code in case anything goes wrong. It's also a resource, in case some of you want to view my code or anything. I've organized it a lot, but it's a little bit hard to navigate. I'll explain bits of the code here.

## Root folder <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3767/3767084.png" alt="folder" width="20"/>

### `index.html`
This is the html file you see in the root (main) folder. All it does is redirect to src/pages/index.html, and add the embed you see on Discord when you paste the website link in.

### images <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3767/3767084.png" alt="folder" width="20"/> , fonts <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3767/3767084.png" alt="folder" width="20"/>
These are quite straightforward.

## src <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3767/3767084.png" alt="folder" width="20"/>
> ah, this is where all the tasty code is

### css <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3767/3767084.png" alt="folder" width="20"/>
Ah yes, the CSS. This folder is split up into many sections, but I only reference one in my HTML file. Basically, what I did was compile all main CSS files into the `all.css` file (`elements.css` and `mainstyling.css`). Then, I compiled all relevant CSS files into `elements.css` and `mainstyling.css`. Why did I do this, instead of making one CSS file only? Well, it's organization. It's hard to understand what different parts of one CSS file do, even with sufficient comments. Splitting it up is easier to comprehend. Plus, you can name the files, and it's more organized that way.

### js <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3767/3767084.png" alt="folder" width="20"/>
Currently, I only have one Javascript file: I'm going to organize this later. I include all my interactivity elements (loading, navigation bar, I think there's more but I forgot).

### pages <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3767/3767084.png" alt="folder" width="20"/>
I only have one page currently, `index.html`. This is the main file, as all of you know. I'm going to add sub-pages soon, but I'm implementing pop-ups in my main file.
